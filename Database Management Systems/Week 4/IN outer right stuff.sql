-- INNER JOIN Condition 

-- inner join returns the matching rows and does not return the unmatching rows. Same casual matching concept is INNER JOIN 

-- LEFT OUTER JOIN 

-- Returns all the rows from the left ( irregardless of it matching with anyone, it returns everything from left) and returns all the matching rows from right 

-- RIGHT OUTER JOIN 

-- Same case as last time except it returns all the right hand side rows and only matching ones from the left 


--EXISTS 

-- returns any row in subquery 
-- whatever you can write in IN, you can write in Exists || Whatever you can write in NOT IN can be written in NOT EXIST too 

-- This returns true or false depending of the subquery any row. and if that condition is successful outer query will work
