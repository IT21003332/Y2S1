Few IPCs when trying Inter process communication

Pipes - Oldest communication method.
	takes a single argument to an array of 2 indexes and process, fd[1] is the write function and fd[0] is the output of the fd1 
	
int fd[2];
if(pipe(fd) < 0)
	printf*("Error");

	
	can use even within a process to communicate
